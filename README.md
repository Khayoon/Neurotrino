React for the frontend user interface.
JSON data files to store information about substances, effects, and neurotransmitter levels.
Express for data manipulation and rendering.
GIF's stored on a MongoDB Atlas cluster for the animations

### Usage
Select a substance from the available options.
Click the "Simulate Effect" button to see the impact of the chosen substance on neurotransmitter levels.
Observe the changes in neurotransmitter and hormone levels displayed on the screen.
Repeat the process with different substances to compare their effects.
Future Enhancements
Include more substances with their corresponding effects to provide a comprehensive simulation.
Implement a feature to track and save personal substance usage history.
Add additional visualizations, such as graphs or charts, to display the changes in neurotransmitter levels over time.
Improve the user interface design to enhance user experience and accessibility.

### Credits
The Neurotransmitter App was developed by Saif Khayoon and Miko Moh as a showcase project to demonstrate full stack web development skills and data visualization techniques.
